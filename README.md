## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository containing two projects: one focused on Path ORAM and the other on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). These projects aim to explore and implement key concepts in the field of secure data storage and cryptographic infrastructure.

## Project 1: Path ORAM
Path ORAM is a cryptographic primitive used for secure and private access to data in an untrusted storage environment. The primary goal of this project is to provide a practical implementation of Path ORAM, demonstrating its effectiveness in protecting sensitive information from potential adversaries.

### Features
Path ORAM Implementation: A fully functional implementation of the Path ORAM algorithm.

## Project 2: Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a critical component of modern secure communication systems. This project focuses on implementing a basic PKI system, providing key generation, certificate issuance, and verification functionalities.

### Features
Key Pair Generation: Generate public-private key pairs for secure communication.
Certificate Authority (CA): Implement a basic CA for issuing and validating digital certificates.
Demo Applications: Example applications demonstrating the use of PKI for secure communication.
Getting Started
For information on setting up and utilizing the PKI project, refer to the dedicated README file within the PKI directory.
